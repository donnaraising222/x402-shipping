> Rate-shop every carrier and buy the label in two paid calls — the label PDF comes back base64 in the response body.

`POST /rates` prices a parcel across every carrier service available for the route and tells you which is cheapest and which is fastest. `POST /label` buys one of those rates and hands you the label — a real PDF, base64-encoded, **in the 200 body** — along with the tracking number. There is no download link to poll and no webhook to wait on.

## Why x402 for this

Shipping APIs gate on an account, a business verification and often a monthly minimum — which is fine for a warehouse and absurd for an agent that needs to mail one thing. x402 prices the two operations that matter at $0.003 and $0.02 and settles them in USDC per call, so an agent with a wallet can rate-shop and ship without anyone opening an account for it. The settlement receipt in each response is the audit trail linking the spend to the label it bought.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nirholas/x402-shipping
cd x402-shipping
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:4023
```

No configuration needed — the server ships with the suite's receive addresses and a deterministic fixture rater that quotes seven real carrier services and issues a valid PDF label, so the demo works before you have any carrier account. Set `PAY_TO_ADDRESS` / `SOLANA_PAY_TO_ADDRESS` to receive funds yourself.

```bash
# 1. Unpaid → 402 listing both rails
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:4023/rates \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"from":{"street1":"215 Clayton St","city":"San Francisco","state":"CA","zip":"94117","country":"US"},"to":{"street1":"1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW","city":"Washington","state":"DC","zip":"20500","country":"US"},"parcel":{"length":10,"width":8,"height":4,"weight":32}}'

# 2. Paid, via any x402 client
npm run client
```

## API

| Route | Price | What you get back |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /rates` | **$0.003** | the full carrier rate table with prices, transit days, and `cheapest` / `fastest` flags |
| `POST /label` | **$0.02** | the label as base64 PDF plus tracking number, tracking URL, carrier, service and the amount charged |
| `GET /health` | free | Liveness, active data source, configured rails |
| `GET /.well-known/x402` | free | Machine-readable discovery manifest |

Every paid route returns the purchased artifact **in the 200 body**. Nothing is deferred to a webhook or a later fetch.

**Pay in USDC on Base or Solana — your client picks the rail.** The 402 challenge always lists both:

| Rail | Network | Asset | payTo |
|---|---|---|---|
| EVM | `base-sepolia` (`base` via `NETWORK=base`) | USDC | `0x40252CFDF8B20Ed757D61ff157719F33Ec332402` |
| Solana | `solana` | USDC (SPL) | `WwwuGbqHrwF5RG89KhUbmRWEvjnRH9k5kVM5p7T3WwW` |

The Solana rail's `extra.feePayer` is a public facilitator sponsor account that pays the SOL network fee, so a buyer needs only USDC — no SOL for gas. Wallets that sign serialized transactions (Phantom, most agent SDKs) can use the built-in helpers at `POST /api/x402-checkout?action=prepare|encode`.

## Real backend / API keys

Two providers are supported; either is free to try.

| Env var | Unlocks |
|---|---|
| `SHIPPO_API_TOKEN` | Live [Shippo](https://goshippo.com) rating + label purchase. Test tokens start `shippo_test_`. |
| `EASYPOST_API_KEY` | Live [EasyPost](https://easypost.com) rating + label purchase. Test keys start `EZTK`. |
| `SHIPPO_BASE_URL` / `EASYPOST_BASE_URL` | Point at a different host — rarely needed. |

Shippo wins if both are set. **Test mode is the default and the safe path**: rates are real rate-table lookups and labels are real PDFs, but nothing ships and no carrier account is charged. The `testMode` field in every response tells you which mode produced it — a production key flips it to `false` and the startup banner says `LIVE — labels cost real money`.

**Without either key, everything still works.** The fixture rater prices seven carrier services on real weight, volume and zone arithmetic, and `POST /label` returns a valid one-page PDF stamped `TEST LABEL - NOT VALID FOR SHIPPING`. Every response is marked `"source": "fixture"`, in the JSON, in the OpenAPI schema and in `skill.md`.

One difference worth knowing: a live `rateId` references a shipment the provider already stored, so `POST /label` needs only the `rateId`. A fixture `rateId` references nothing, so fixture mode asks you to re-send `from`/`to`/`parcel` — the service will not invent an address it was never given.

## Human checkout

For a browser-facing checkout, drop in [`@three-ws/x402-payment-modal`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@three-ws/x402-payment-modal) — it reads the 402 challenge and drives the whole connect → sign → settle flow for **both** rails (Phantom on Solana, any injected wallet on EVM), with SIWX re-entry so a returning buyer skips the wallet prompt, and client-side spending caps that stop an agent or a mis-click from over-spending. Reference it from npm or the CDN; it is a separate proprietary package and is never vendored here.

## For AI agents

- **[`skill.md`](skill.md)** — the agent-facing contract: every endpoint, its price, its response schema, and how to pay. Point your agent at this file.
- **`GET /.well-known/x402`** — machine-readable discovery ([manifest](public/.well-known/x402)). Lists both rails per resource.
- **[`examples/mcp-tool.md`](examples/mcp-tool.md)** — expose this service as an MCP tool for Claude in about 30 lines.
- **[`examples/agent-client.ts`](examples/agent-client.ts)** — a complete paid call with `x402-fetch`, printing the artifact and the decoded settlement receipt.
- **Discovery/listing** — indexable by [x402scan.com](https://x402scan.com), the [x402 Bazaar](https://x402.org), and [agentic.market](https://agentic.market). Deploy, then submit your public base URL; all three read `/.well-known/x402`.
